# DX Findings: Building the Blog Example

## Pain Points & Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Initial Setup Complexity**
- **Issue**: Need to manually create `policies.ts` before generating - the generator expects it to exist
- **Solution**: Generator could create a default `policies.ts` if it doesn't exist with permissive defaults and comments

### 2. **Import Path Confusion**
- **Issue**: The README shows imports like `@/lib/flow/post/client` but actual structure requires `/hooks` or `/forms`
- **Solution**: Either add barrel exports at model level OR update README to show correct import paths

### 3. **FlowProvider Setup**
- **Issue**: Not immediately clear that FlowProvider needs to wrap the app
- **Solution**: Add a "Quick Start" section to README with numbered steps

### 4. **Missing Prisma Client**
- **Issue**: After generation, imports fail because Prisma client isn't generated
- **Solution**: Generator could check and warn if Prisma client doesn't exist, or auto-run `prisma generate client`

### 5. **TypeScript Errors on First Run**
- **Issue**: Components importing from `/lib/flow` before it's generated cause TS errors
- **Solution**: Could provide stub types or a pre-generation script

## Positive Experiences

### 1. **Excellent Type Safety**
- Once generated, the type inference is fantastic
- Zod schemas automatically validate all inputs
- Transform functions handle null/undefined seamlessly

### 2. **Autosave Feature**
- Field-level save states are incredibly useful
- Visual feedback (saving/saved/error) improves UX significantly
- Debouncing works perfectly out of the box

### 3. **Policy Integration**
- Authorization "just works" once policies are defined
- The `where` and `data` merging in policies is very powerful
- Clear separation between auth logic and business logic

### 4. **React Query Integration**
- Hooks feel native and intuitive
- Optimistic updates work flawlessly
- Cache invalidation is automatic and correct

## Suggested README Improvements

### Add a "Quick Start" Section
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install next-prisma-flow-state-engine --save-dev
   npm install @tanstack/react-query zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers @prisma/client prisma
   ```

2. Add generator to schema.prisma:
   ```prisma
   generator flow {
     provider = "next-prisma-flow-state-engine"
     output = "./lib/flow"
   }
   ```

3. Create policies file at `lib/flow/policies.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export async function canModelName(action, ctx, id) {
     return { ok: true }; // Start permissive, refine later
   }
   ```

4. Generate code:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. Wrap app with FlowProvider:
   ```typescript
   <FlowProvider ctx={yourAuthContext}>
     {children}
   </FlowProvider>
   ```
```

### Clarify Import Patterns
Show the actual file structure and import paths:
```markdown
## Import Patterns

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - import from specific files
import { usePost } from '@/lib/flow/post/client/hooks'
import { usePostForm } from '@/lib/flow/post/client/forms'

// ❌ Wrong - no barrel exports at model level
import { usePost } from '@/lib/flow/post/client'
```
```

### Add Common Patterns Section
```markdown
## Common Patterns

### Autosave Forms
Shows field-level save states for better UX:
```typescript
const { fieldSaveStates } = usePostForm({ 
  autosave: { enabled: true } 
})
// fieldSaveStates.title = 'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved' | 'error'
```

### Optimistic Delete
Immediately removes item from UI:
```typescript
const deletePost = useDeletePost(id, {
  onSuccess: () => router.push('/')
})
```
```

## Generator Enhancement Ideas

1. **Init Command**: `npx next-prisma-flow init` to scaffold initial setup
2. **Better Error Messages**: Check for common issues and provide helpful errors
3. **Dev Mode**: Watch mode for schema changes
4. **Type Stubs**: Generate minimal types before full generation to prevent TS errors
5. **Migration Helpers**: Detect schema changes that need policy updates

## Overall Assessment

The generator provides excellent DX once everything is set up, but the initial setup has some friction points. The main issues are around initial configuration and understanding the import patterns. The actual usage of the generated code is fantastic - type-safe, performant, and feature-rich.

The autosave with field-level tracking is a standout feature that significantly improves form UX. The policy system is powerful and flexible. Overall, this is a great tool that could benefit from a smoother onboarding experience.
