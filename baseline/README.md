# Golden Baseline: Todo Implementation

This directory contains the manually crafted "golden baseline" implementation for the Todo model that serves as the reference standard for what the generator should produce.

## Purpose

This baseline serves multiple purposes:

1. **Quality Target**: Defines the standard of code quality the generator should achieve
2. **Testing Reference**: Used for automated testing to validate generator output
3. **Documentation**: Shows best practices and patterns for generated code
4. **Regression Prevention**: Ensures new generator versions maintain quality

## Structure

```

## Quality Standards

This baseline demonstrates:

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper type inference
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- **Performance**: Optimized patterns for React rendering and state updates
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code with proper separation of concerns

### Architecture Patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with rollback on failure
- **Loading States**: Granular loading states for different operations
- **Form Integration**: Smart form hooks with validation and auto-save
- **Cache Management**: Proper Next.js cache invalidation
- **State Management**: Efficient Jotai atoms with derived state

### API Design
- **Consistency**: Consistent naming and pattern conventions
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API with unified hooks
- **Flexibility**: Support for both simple and advanced use cases
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization

## Testing Usage

The generator test suite uses this baseline to:

1. **Structure Validation**: Compare generated file structure
2. **Type Checking**: Validate TypeScript compatibility
3. **Functionality Testing**: Ensure all methods work correctly
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare performance characteristics
5. **Integration Testing**: Test with real React components

## Version Compatibility

This baseline is compatible with:
- Next.js 13.4+ (App Router)
- React 18+
- Jotai 2.6+
- Prisma 5.0+
- TypeScript 5.0+

## Maintenance

When updating the generator:
1. First update this baseline to design and implement new features
1. Update the generator and implement the new features
2. Run the test suite to ensure compatibility
3. Document any breaking changes or improvements
4. Update version compatibility notes

*This baseline represents the gold standard for generated code quality and should be maintained as the primary reference for what "good" generated code looks like.*
